# Task

Make the pactum agent skill self-sufficient and one-command installable, so a stranger driving pactum through their coding agent (Claude Code or Codex) reliably follows the safe workflow. Two parts: (A) rewrite the skill content so an agent does not need to read the reference files first, and (B) add a `pactum skill install` command that go:embeds the skill and writes it to the correct per-agent directory.

Background (from a Claude+Codex+Gemini design review): agents reliably SKIP "read references/workflow.md before acting" — they see an inline skeleton and start running commands, or skip context entirely (the same way our executor ignored the repo map). So the skill's entry file must be self-contained for the safe path, with the reference files demoted to optional enrichment. Pactum's real strength is its machine affordances: every --json command carries a `next` array of legal next commands and failures carry error.code/error.fix. The safety boundary is already machine-enforced: `pactum execute run` is never advertised in any `next` array, so an agent that only runs commands from `next` cannot auto-cross into unsandboxed execution.

In scope:

A. Rewrite assets/agent-skills/pactum/SKILL.md into a self-sufficient, next-driven "agent card" for the safe happy path:
- Keep YAML frontmatter `name: pactum` + `description` only (stay on the Agent Skills common subset that BOTH Claude Code and Codex accept; do NOT add Claude-only fields like disable-model-invocation).
- Inline the COMPLETE safe command sequence with `--json` on every command (init/status, map refresh if stale, task new, search + read, clarify, contract show/revise/approve, prompt build, execute plan — the safe stop).
- State the core loop rule explicitly: after each command, read the `next` array and run ONLY commands it lists; if `next` is empty, STOP and report to the user; on failure, use error.fix.
- Keep the dangerous rules inline and repeat them at the boundary: never run `pactum execute run` or `pactum review run` by default; `pactum execute plan` is the stop point; and add: do NOT implement source changes by hand after `execute plan` — pactum stops there unless the user explicitly exits pactum or approves unsandboxed execution (otherwise the agent runs the plan then just edits code itself).
- Do NOT hardcode `--agent codex`; use a placeholder/`<agent>` and tell the agent to use the configured executor (detect codex vs claude or ask), since claude users must not be steered to codex.
- Make map/search non-optional where it is pactum's value: instruct the agent to use `pactum search`/read for required context discovery and not substitute raw rg/cat unless pactum directs otherwise.
- Fix the `.heurema` rule (the current "do not commit .heurema/" conflicts with pactum's own durable run-record story): say do not include `.heurema/pactum` churn in feature commits, never delete or revert it, and report it separately unless the user asks for an audit-record commit.
- Specify the exact final report format: run id, contract status (approved or not), the plan command, files likely touched, and an explicit "stopped at execute plan" statement.
- Update the SKILL.md pointers and the reference files so references/workflow.md, install.md, safety.md are clearly OPTIONAL enrichment/detail, not required reading before acting.

B. Add a `pactum skill install` command:
- go:embed the assets/agent-skills/pactum/ package into the binary (a new embed source) so the installed binary can write the skill out without the repo present. Add a test that the embedded copy is byte-identical to assets/agent-skills/pactum/ (anti-drift), extending the existing internal/docs skill sync test rather than duplicating it.
- `pactum skill install --agent <claude|codex|auto|all> --scope <user|repo>`:
  - claude → user: ~/.claude/skills/pactum/ ; repo: .claude/skills/pactum/
  - codex  → user: ~/.agents/skills/pactum/ ; repo: .agents/skills/pactum/
  - auto detects which agent skill dirs / CLIs are present; all installs to every known target.
  - DEFAULT scope is repo (.<agent>/skills) for alpha, so a global skill does not trigger on every repository the user opens.
  - Idempotent overwrite; print the installed path, the skill version (the pactum binary version), and a note to reload/restart the agent if the skill does not appear.
- Add a discovery check (`pactum skill doctor`, or `skill install --check`): verify the skill files exist at the expected path for the selected agent/scope and that SKILL.md frontmatter parses.
- JSON output (`--json`) consistent with the rest of the CLI (carry `next` and the error envelope where applicable).

C. Update docs/skill-install.md to lead with `pactum skill install` as the one-command path (per-agent, correct paths), keeping manual copy as a documented fallback.

Out of scope: any marketplace/plugin distribution; changing the staged workflow commands themselves; the binary release workflow (separate); Gemini/Antigravity-specific skill paths beyond a noted comment (alpha targets claude + codex).

Tests (helper/temp-dir; do not invoke real agents): embedded skill is byte-identical to the on-disk package; `skill install` writes the package to the correct directory for each --agent and --scope into a temp HOME/repo; idempotent re-install; doctor/check reports present vs absent correctly; SKILL.md frontmatter still parses and the existing skill sync test passes.

Validation: go test ./internal/..., go test ./..., go build ./..., make check.
