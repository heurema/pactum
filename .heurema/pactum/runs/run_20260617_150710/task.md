# Task

Surface cache reuse and effective cost in the existing 'pactum usage' command. The data is already captured and computed — it is just not shown.

Today 'pactum usage' reports input/output/total tokens + 'captured N/M' per group (and in --json: input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens, captured_only, lower_bound). The usage records also carry cache_read_tokens and cache_creation_tokens, and internal/app/usage.go already computes effective_units (the provider-weighted cost proxy: fresh×1.0 + cache_write×{1.25 anthropic | 1.0 openai} + cache_read×0.1 + output×5 via recordEffectiveUnits) — but the summary response and the human table do not expose them.

Add to BOTH the human table and the --json output, per group AND for the TOTAL:
- cache_read_tokens and cache_creation_tokens (sum per group/total).
- cache_read_ratio = cache_read_tokens / input_tokens (0 when input is 0). In the human table render it as a percent column (e.g. 'cache 94%').
- effective_units = the already-computed provider-weighted proxy, summed per group and total. Render as a column in the human table and a field in JSON.

The motivation: raw input is misleading because most of it is cheap cache-read (0.1x), so effective_units is the number that actually bills and cache_read_ratio explains why raw input overstates cost. The human table should make this legible at a glance — suggested columns: STAGE/KEY, INPUT, cache%, OUTPUT, EFFECTIVE, CAPTURED. Keep the existing TOTAL row + coverage line + lower-bound behavior. Uncaptured records contribute no tokens, no cache, no effective units (consistent with today).

Constraints: do NOT change the usage-recording path, the effective_units formula/multipliers, or any other command; do NOT add dollar cost; keep --by stage|model|agent|provider, --all, --json, and the coverage/lower-bound behavior intact; bump the JSON schema additively (still pactum.usage_summary.v1alpha1, additive fields only). Validation: go test ./internal/app -run Usage, go test ./..., go build ./..., make check.
