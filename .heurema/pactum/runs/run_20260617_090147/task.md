# Task

Rework the pactum config to the new pipeline shape and wire it through the existing code; behaviour-preserving (no new runtime capability), config FORMAT change only. No users, so breaking the config shape is free.

NEW top-level config keys: version (string, value v1alpha1 — REPLACES the old schema: pactum.config.v1alpha1 field; the config file is standalone so renaming its version field is safe; do NOT touch the schema discriminator on any other artifact/record type); agents (unchanged: [{name, model, effort?}]); map (unchanged); out_of_scope (string, block|warn — REPLACES gate.scope_enforcement; drop the gate: wrapper); pipeline (a map of stage -> {by, loop?}). Remove the old top-level keys schema, gate, review, contract, clarify, timeouts.

pipeline stages and their value shape: clarify, contract_draft, contract_review, execute, code_review, memory. Each stage is an object. by: is the performer(s) — a scalar agent name OR a list, normalized to []string. loop: is {max, patience, settle} (optional).

VALIDATION (load-time): loop: is valid ONLY on clarify, contract_review, code_review (the loop stages); loop on contract_draft/execute/memory is a load error. A by: LIST (len>1) is valid ONLY on contract_review and code_review (the existing panels); len>1 on any other stage is a load error. Every by: agent name must resolve in agents (else load error). out_of_scope must be block or warn. Reject unknown top-level keys and unknown stage names.

MAPPING (the resolver must reproduce today's behaviour exactly): review.panel -> pipeline.code_review.by; review.{max_rounds,patience,clean_rounds} -> pipeline.code_review.loop.{max,patience,settle}; contract.reviewers -> pipeline.contract_review.by; contract_review now ALSO gets loop knobs via pipeline.contract_review.loop.{max,patience,settle} (today it reuses the review limits — keep that resolution, just sourced from pipeline.contract_review.loop, falling back to the same defaults); clarify.max_rounds -> pipeline.clarify.loop.max; gate.scope_enforcement -> out_of_scope. Single-agent stages contract_draft/execute/memory and clarify each name their agent via by:; these must reproduce today's resolved per-stage agent assignment (verify against run.go role-resolution before hardcoding the default config's by: values).

Update the default-config writer to emit the new shape. Update all config call sites (config.Schema, config.Review.*, config.Contract.*, config.Gate.*, config.Clarify.*, config.Timeouts.*) to read from the new structs. Update config tests.

Constraints: behaviour-preserving (same agents/limits resolve as today); do NOT change internal/loop, the loop bodies (review_loop.go/contract_review.go/clarify_loop.go logic), or add multi-model/best-of-N. Validation: go build ./..., go test ./..., make check, and go test ./internal/app -run TestReadConfig.
