# Task

Make the review loop (both contract_review and code_review, which share internal/app/review_loop.go) never silently terminate with an OPEN BLOCKING finding as if the run were approvable, and stop the fixer from burning all rounds when it makes no progress on a blocker.

Observed problem (live): on a large contract the contract-review loop ran the full max_rounds, hit a stalemate/max_rounds terminal, and HANDED BACK a contract with a real blocking finding still open — appearing as a normal stop, so an operator could approve a contract that still has an unresolved blocker. Separately, the fixer kept failing to land the one blocking finding round after round, burning all rounds rewording around it.

In scope:
1. Loud, non-approvable terminal on open blockers: when the loop terminates via stalemate or max_rounds while there is at least one OPEN BLOCKING finding, the terminal_reason / status must be a DISTINCT, clearly non-approvable terminal (e.g. blockers_open) rather than the generic stalemate/max_rounds that reads as a clean stop. The summary/output must make the open blocking count prominent.
2. Approve guard holds: contract approve and review approve must REFUSE while any blocking finding is open (verify the existing guard; if it already refuses, ensure the loop's terminal state and human/JSON output surface the open blocker loudly and point the operator at it via next-commands, instead of looking like a successful convergence). The two-layer point: the loop must not pretend to have resolved a blocker it did not.
3. Fixer-no-progress escalation: if the fixer fails to change the set/status of OPEN BLOCKING findings for K consecutive rounds (K small, e.g. 2), stop early with a distinct escalation terminal rather than running the remaining rounds rewording around the same blocker. Record the escalation reason.
4. Advisory findings must not drive non-convergence: the loop converges once all BLOCKING findings are resolved; advisory (non-blocking) findings are recorded but do not extend the loop or count toward non-convergence. If this is already the behavior, add a test that locks it.

Keep max_rounds default at 10 (the round count is not the lever). Do not change the reviewer panel composition, the reviewer-findings capture/parse (that is the shipped #196 behavior), or add reviewer-attempt timeouts (separate slice). Do not reintroduce any plan-DAG concept (removed).

Tests: a loop run that ends at stalemate/max_rounds with an open blocking finding produces the distinct non-approvable terminal and approve refuses; a fixer that makes no progress on a blocker for K rounds escalates early instead of running all rounds; advisory-only remaining findings converge clean; existing convergence (blockers cleared) still reaches the resolved/clean terminal. Cover both contract_review and the shared review_loop paths with helper-process fixtures; do not invoke real agents.

Validation: go test ./internal/app -run 'Review|Loop|Contract', go test ./..., go build ./..., make check.
