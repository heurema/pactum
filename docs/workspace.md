# Workspace layout

Pactum stores everything for a repository under a single workspace directory:

```
.heurema/pactum/
```

`pactum init` creates it. The workspace holds the project map, the per-run
artifacts, the accepted project memory, the event ledger, and scratch space.

└── tmp/                     # scratch temp
```

The `cache/current-run` file records the **current run** that `pactum task new`
and `pactum task use` set, so staged commands can omit the run id. It is
local-only generated state — never commit it.

## Generated vs durable artifacts

The workspace mixes two kinds of artifacts.

**Generated artifacts** are reproducible from your repository and configuration,
or are large/scratch output. They can be deleted and rebuilt and are not worth
tracking in version control. The `.gitignore` that `pactum init` writes inside
the workspace ignores exactly these areas:

```
locks/
map/
ledger/
cache/
tmp/
runs/*/ledger/
runs/*/execute/
runs/*/review/
```

- `map/` — rebuilt at any time with `pactum map refresh` (includes the
  generated `wiki/` pages and the binary `search.sqlite` index). The map is
  wiki-first: start at `map/wiki/overview.md`. The wiki is generated from
  deterministic facts (file inventory and manifests).
- `ledger/` and `runs/*/ledger/` — append-only event logs.
- `cache/`, `tmp/`, `locks/` — scratch and coordination state.
- `runs/*/execute/` — captured agent stdout/stderr and attempt records, which
  can be large and machine-specific.
- `runs/*/review/` — reviewer attempts and the review record. These are useful
  audit artifacts, but are ignored by default because reviewer attempts and
  captured reviewer output can be noisy.

**Durable artifacts** are the contract-first record of a run and the accepted
project memory. These are small, deterministic, and meaningful to a human:

- `manifest.json` and `config.yaml`.
- The normally commit-friendly record of a run: `run.json`, `task.md`, and the
  `context/`, `clarify/`, `contract/`, `gate/`, and `memory/` directories —
  the task, its context, the approved contract, the gate report, and the
  run-local memory candidate.
- Project memory: `memory/items.jsonl`, `memory/project-memory.md`, and
  `memory/refreshes.jsonl`.

### Review artifacts are not in the default durable set

The review outcome lives under `runs/*/review/`, and it is a useful audit
artifact. But it is **not** part of the default durable, commit-friendly set:
the workspace `.gitignore` ignores `runs/*/review/` because reviewer attempts
and captured reviewer output can be noisy. A team that wants the review record
in version control can track it deliberately — by changing the ignore policy or
by force-adding specific review files — but Pactum does not make review
artifacts commit-friendly by default. The normally commit-friendly durable run
artifacts are the task, context, contract, gate, and memory artifacts above.

## Why not to blindly commit `.heurema/`

Do not run `git add .heurema/` from the repository root expecting the whole tree
to be safe to commit. The workspace deliberately contains generated, binary, and
scratch content (the SQLite search index, caches, agent logs) that is large,
path- or machine-specific, regenerable, and noisy in diffs.

The workspace ships its own `.gitignore` (the list above), but that file only
applies to paths **inside** `.heurema/pactum/` — it does not stop you from adding
the generated areas if you force them, and it does not decide for you whether the
workspace should be tracked at all.

You have two reasonable choices:

- **Track nothing.** Add `.heurema/` to your repository's root `.gitignore` and
  treat the workspace as local-only state.
- **Track the durable record.** Leave the workspace `.gitignore` in place and
  commit the durable artifacts listed above when your team wants traceability —
  the approved contract, clarifications, gate report, and accepted project
  memory for a run are a useful audit trail. The review outcome under
  `runs/*/review/` is ignored by default and is not part of this trail; track it
  deliberately only if your team chooses to (see above). Commit deliberately and
  review what you are adding; let the workspace `.gitignore` keep the generated
  areas out.
